# Comp-490-Individual-Primer-Project


This is my individual primer project.

It reads the username and password and uses the get verb to send the information to the cgi.

The Cgi then uses the query string to return the values that the user put into the html page

The link to the html page is http://www.csun.edu/~jm12232/cgi_bin/new.html

I stored the new.cgi and new.html in my cgi_bin folder so it should work
